Building upon my prior research, which introduced a nuanced approach to spam classification and supplied a brand-new ’warranted spam’ dataset, I will be working towards addressing the future work section by exploration the realm of email content analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. My previous work highlighted the challenges posed by user driven spam flagging and the subsequent biases introduced in spam filters. With the foundation of the ’warranted spam’ dataset,  combined with the Bruce Guenter "unwarranted spam" dataset, I am poised to delve deeper into the textual intricacies of these emails. My primary objective is to harness the capabilities of LLMs and/or NLP techniques to differentiate between warranted and unwarranted spam by analyzing the textual content of emails. LLMs, with their ability to discern semantics, context, and recurring patterns, present a promising avenue for effective classification of warranted and unwarranted spam. Since the warranted spam dataset is composed of commercial correspondence that falls in 28 categories, I aim to employ LLMs and/or NLP techniques for in-depth content categorization of emails, providing insights into the intent and nature of emails. This categorization will aid filters and users in understanding the underlying motivations behind emails, especially when comparing the sentiment of warranted commercial communications against potential phishing or scam emails. By juxtaposing the sentiments of these two distinct categories, I hope to shed light on the emotional tactics employed by both legitimate marketers and malicious actors. The ultimate goal of this research is to refine spam filtering techniques, ensuring that genuine communications are accurately identified and easily categorized, while also safeguarding users from potential threats. This endeavor not only seeks to enhance online safety but also aims to provide businesses with actionable insights to refine their email communication strategies.

For this project, I want to use a RNN/LSTM, a pretrained encoder transformer like BERT that you can get off HuggingFace, and a decoder transformer like GPT, if only though the API.

Let's focus on the classification and sentiment of the unwarranted dataset (Bruce Guenter) and the warranted spam dataset.
